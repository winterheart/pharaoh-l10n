"As devotion to their patron gods continues to grow, the Egyptian people demand bigger and bigger places of worship. Most cities will want to erect a Temple Complex to their chosen god, so that they may fully partake of his or her benevolence. Once built, the Temple Complex may be expanded through the addition of an Oracle and an Altar, each dedicated to other, lesser gods. These gods, too, will impart certain benefits to the city.\n"
"With a supply of gemstones, Jewelers in your city can fashion jewelry. Jewelry is one type of valuable luxury good, which the higher social classes in the city demand. \n"
"In addition to locally made Jewelry, the Egyptian people prize certain other luxury goods, which are available only through importation. A city needs access to more than one type of luxury good in order to become truly civilized. "
