"Ramses the Great (Ramses II) ruled Egypt ca. 1279-1212 BC. This long-lived "
"pharaoh is renowned for the many temples and monuments built during his "
"reign, the grandest of which was Abu Simbel. About 350 miles south of Waset "
"(Thebes), in the province of Nubia, Ramses' stonemasons carved a row of four"
" seated statues of the pharaoh in the pink sandstone cliffs overlooking the "
"Nile valley.  Each statue is over 66 feet tall - only the Great Sphinx at "
"Giza is taller.  The seated figures flank a tunnel entrance that leads to an"
" inner sanctum dug 160 feet into the cliff. The temple faces east and was "
"designed so that twice a year light from the rising sun penetrates to the "
"rear wall of the sanctum, illuminating three smaller statues of Ramses, Amun"
" and Ra. A statue of Ptah is also located in the sanctum, but because he is "
"associated with the underworld, his statue is positioned so that sunlight "
"does not fall upon it.  Reliefs inside the temple also commemorate Ramses' "
"military victories, particularly his battle at Kadesh, which is pictorially "
"represented on five other of his temples. Nearby, a sister temple carved "
"into the cliffs honors the goddess Hathor and Ramses' foremost wife, Queen "
"Nefertari. The whole complex was intended to awe the Nubian subjects and "
"encourage tributes from them. Abu Simbel was completed ca. 1256 BC.  Over "
"the millenia sands buried it.  In 1817 archaeologist Giovanni Belzoni "
"uncovered the massive monument. Threatened to be covered again in the mid "
"1960s, this time by waters rising behind the newly constructed Aswan High "
"Dam, Abu Simbel was cut out of the cliff and reconstructed with great "
"precision on higher ground - an engineering feat that would surely have "
"impressed the ancient Egyptians."

"From its inception, Alexander the Great hoped that Alexandria, the city at "
"the mouth of the Nile that he founded and helped plan, would become a center"
" of trade and culture for the Mediterranean basin. Less than fifty years "
"after its founding in 331 BC, the booming metropolis had become a "
"sophisticated hub of commerce, due in large part to its famed Great Library."
"  Soon after Alexander's unexpected early death in 323 BC, his expansive "
"empire dissolved into three major regions. One of his closest friends and "
"ablest generals, Ptolemy, was at the time the de facto governor of Egypt. He"
" took control of that ancient land, eventually becoming pharaoh (as Ptolemy "
"I Soter) and thus continuing the Greek presence in Egypt begun by Alexander."
" It was Ptolemy that intercepted Alexander's funerary procession, bound for "
"Macedonia, and brought his mortal remains to Alexandria for internment, "
"though archaeologists have not yet found his tomb. Besides personal glory "
"and luxurious living, however, the early Ptolemaic rulers were, to their "
"credit, also interested in bettering the culture of their city and its land."
" Alexandria, Egypt's new capital, was already the center of commerce for the"
" known world; they wanted it to become the intellectual capital as well. To "
"this end Alexandria's Great Library was conceived and built. The Great "
"Library was mankind's first center of scholastic learning and research. The "
"brilliant minds of antiquity here laid the foundations for the systematic "
"study of astronomy, geography, literature, mathematics, medicine, and "
"physics. It was here that Euclid first defined geometry and Eratosthenes "
"accurately measured the circumference of the earth, arguing that India could"
" be reached by sailing westward from Spain. The Ptolemys devoted much time "
"and energy, and not a small portion of their wealth, to obtaining copies of "
"every important manuscript known to man. To this end a law was passed "
"proclaiming that every caravan and ship entering Alexandria was to be "
"searched - not for contraband, but for articles of learning. Any map or "
"scroll found was turned in to the library so that scribes could copy it. "
"Thus Alexandria's scholarly haven eventually contained over 500,000 "
"systematically cataloged papyri scrolls, including many now-lost "
"masterpieces of art, literature and science, such as classics by Homer, "
"Aristotle, Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripedes. But all was not letters of "
"learning. The legendary library's grounds also boasted of a botanical garden"
" and a museum, as well as a temple to the nine muses (Greek gods and "
"goddesses of the arts and sciences). A short stroll along a garden-lined "
"palisade would take one to a <link=\"#Zoo_Title\"><u>zoo</u></link> thay may"
" have been built there as well, no doubt containing many exotic animals. "
"Many were the ancient scholars that walked its colonnaded passages. What led"
" to the Great Library's demise is not completely clear. A good portion of "
"its priceless works was evidently destroyed in a fire that occurred when "
"Julius Caesar torched the ships of Cleopatra VII's brother. By the fourth "
"century AD, as Christianity's influence was spreading, most of the remaining"
" manuscripts of the Library were apparently destroyed in an effort to stamp "
"out all relics of paganism and heresy. Of the 123 plays of Sophocles that "
"were known to be in the Great Library, only seven remain today."

Did they make barley or grain beers?  And what about malting?  Research is underway to answer all of these questions. \n"
"Based on pictures found on tomb walls, one beer-making method the Egyptians used involved baking a special loaf of bread. This bread was crushed and placed in a sieve. Then, water was forced through it and the ensuing concoction was bottled and fermented. Most art shows men brewing beer while women ground flour. Some women brewed beer, but it seems to be mainly a male profession. About 17 types of beer have been identified in papyri. \n"
"The Egyptians drank their beer out of specially designed mugs. The mugs were outfitted with an angled pipe, a little like a straw. At the end of the pipe was a filter, which sifted out any solid material that might be in the beer. In addition to drinking beer at home, Egyptians also drank beer in taverns and inns.

Sometimes, the cattle were sent to fields that had been recently harvested to eat straw and chaff. \n"

The most efficient way to catch fish, however, was the drag net. Because the catch would be so great, bringing a drag net back to the surface required two boats of men. \n"
"There were dangers involved in the fishing profession. One species of catfish had a poisonous spine on its dorsal fin, and there was always the danger of hippopotamuses and crocodiles. Fishermen were safe enough in their boats, but should the boat capsize, the crocodile was seldom far behind."

Then, internal organs were removed from the corpse and stored in containers called canopic jars. The only organ that was discarded was the brain (which was removed through the nose) because the ancient Egyptians believed that it served no purpose. The canopic jars were entombed with the body. \n"
"After removing the internal organs, the embalmer filled the body cavity with perfumes, oils, and linen and closed the body up. Then, the body was covered in natron, a type of salt. After 70 days, the body was rinsed off, wrapped in linen and smeared with bitumen. The bitumen helped to kill bacteria and fungi that would otherwise work to decompose the body. \n"

In years of low or no Inundation, famine struck Egypt, which was sometimes enough to topple governments. \n"
"To take advantage of the restoring Inundation, dykes were built around farms to capture the water as it rose. As the Nile receded (the season called peret), the water, along with its nutrients, slowly soaked into the soil. After about six weeks, the farmer opened the dykes and let the rest of the water drain out. Of course, being submerged in water made the ground quite soft. Before he could sow his seed, the farmer had to wait for the land to dry out a little and become firm. \n"

The last five days of the Egyptian year were spent celebrating, and numerous other festivals occurred throughout the year. \n"
"It was during festivals in honor of a deity that all people had somewhat more access to state gods than usual. At the center of religious festivals was the procession of the god. During the festival, the statue of the god that resided in the temple, beyond public view, was outfitted in its finest garments and paraded through town on a ceremonial bark borne by priests. The priests rested periodically, during which time rites were performed. During the New Kingdom, citizens could ask the god questions while the priests were resting.

"Sometimes, the gods travelled quite far and were transported by boat. For example, during the Opet festival, Amun travelled from Karnak to his southern chapel at Luxor. To make the journey, he sailed along the Nile. Opet was one of the most joyous festivals and lasted anywhere from 11-27 days. \n"
"Traditionally, when a king reached his 30th year of rule, he celebrated his heb-sed, or jubilee festival. Then, this was celebrated every three or four years thereafter.

Some pharaohs didn't wait until their 30th regnal year before celebrating their heb-sed and celebrated them much earlier in their reigns.\n"

This process was certainly very time consuming. Nevertheless, gold was relatively plentiful and was, in fact, easier to obtain than silver. \n"

The irrigation canals extended the benefits of the river, bringing nourishing silt to areas away from the river. \n"
"Early in Egyptian history, farmers who wanted to irrigate their land had a tough time of it. Farmers irrigated their land by hand, carrying a yoke with two buckets made of clay or leather to the Nile or some other water source. The farmer returned with his buckets of water to his farm, which was subdivided by small dykes. The dykes captured the water, maximizing the benefit of this slow and arduous method of irrigation.  \n"
"At the beginning of the 18th dynasty (about 1300 BC), the water lift, or shaduf, was introduced. The shaduf probably came to Egypt from Mesopotamia, where it had been in use as early as 2370 BC. Positioned on the bank of the Nile or other water source, the shaduf was made from a long wooden beam that rocked back and forth on a pivot. A bucket at one end of the beam was counterbalanced with a brick or other weight. A person pushed down on the end with the bucket to dip it into the water, and the brick helped the worker lift the water into the gully that was attached to the shaduf. \n"
"The introduction of the shaduf increased the arable land in Egypt by about 15 percent. Also, because it was never submerged under water, land irrigated by the shaduf could produce two harvests a year instead of one."

"The myth that defines Osiris links him with agriculture, the Nile and funerary customs. Ra-Atum gave Osiris rule of ancient Egypt. Osiris married his sister, Isis, and taught the people many things as its ruler, most importantly the art of agriculture. After he schooled the Egyptians, Osiris left Egypt to civilize the rest of the world, leaving Isis in charge. Isis ruled well in his absence, but upon Osiris' return, his brother, Seth, began to plot against him. Seth invited Osiris to a sumptuous feast where he produced a beautiful coffin. He offered the coffin to whomever it best fit. When Osiris climbed in the coffin, Seth shut the lid and threw the coffin into the Nile. Isis managed to fish the coffin out of the Nile, but Seth caught her and hacked Osiris to pieces. Isis, distraught, cried, and her tears were believed to be the cause of the Inundation. Eventually, Isis and Nephthys gathered up the scattered pieces of Osiris' body except his genitalia, which had been consumed by the oxyrhynchus fish. Anubis, god of embalming, wrapped Osiris together with linen, in the same way that human bodies were wrapped in the mummification process.. Egyptians were, understandably, banned from eating the oxyrhynchus fish. Eventually, Osiris became the god of the underworld and was the supreme judge who granted or denied entry into the afterlife. \n"
"Sebek, the crocodile god, was a fertility god who was worshipped primarily in the Fayuum, although he was known throughout Egypt. His name translates as 'watching over you.'  Min, god of regeneration, was also associated with male fertility and worshipped throughout Egypt."

"It was unlikely that there was a home that did not possess pottery. Pottery manufacture, one of the oldest industries in ancient Egypt, originated in the home, where women produced whatever vessels were needed for cooking. Like other industries in Egypt, pottery making moved from the milieu of the home to the workshop. \n"
"The first step to making pottery was preparing the <link=\"#Clay_Title\"><u>clay</u></link> for use. The clay had to be kneaded, and often straw or chaff was added to the clay to act as a binding agent. Men kneaded the clay by hand or by foot, stepping on it to make the clay workable. The clay was then placed on a wheel to be shaped. \n"
"The potter's wheel evolved through time. In its earliest form, the potter turned the wheel with one hand while molding the clay with the other. Because the potter could not turn the wheel very fast, the pottery had to be smoothed by hand later. During the New Kingdom, a second person spun the wheel with both hands while the potter shaped the vessel. This led to a much smoother finished product. By the end of the New Kingdom, the potter was again spinning his own wheel, this time with his feet, which yielded the smoothest pottery yet. \n"
"After the vessels were shaped, they were left to dry. The pieces were decorated during the drying process. After drying, they were fired in a kiln. The kiln was a large oven with a fire chamber at its base. The fire chamber was separated from an upper chamber by a clay grid. Pottery was placed on this grid. The top chamber was sealed except for a hole to let smoke out. Once firing was complete, the product was finished and stored until needed."

"Because ancient Egypt was a theocracy, priests frequently assumed administrative roles within their communities, sometimes dispensing justice. Their role extended far beyond religious duties. \n"
"The mark of a priest was his cleanliness. The priests underwent purification rites before they could enter the temple and shaved off their hair to ensure they did not harbor lice or other impurities. Depending on which god a priest served, he was prohibited from eating certain types of food. Priests had special clothing. The priests performing mortuary cult rituals adorned themselves with leopard skins. \n"
"The primary religious concern for the priesthood was the care and feeding of the resident god. Each temple had a statue of its patron god on the premises. Each priest in the temple had his own responsibility to make sure the god was happy. Some of the priests were in charge of making sure the god was well fed. Using food that had been given as an offering by locals or produced on the temple's estate, the priests prepared a meal for the god. The god would partake of the 'essence' of the food, and the priests ate the leftovers. The priests also clothed and bathed the god and provided entertainment. Occasionally, the god would be taken on an outing and paraded through the city (see <link=\"#Festival_Title\"><u>festivals</u></link> for more). \n"
"The priesthood was divided into distinct classes. The most elite priest was the High Priest, also called the First Prophet, who was appointed by the pharaoh. The High Priest was the ultimate authority within the temple and frequently served as an advisor to the pharaoh. Beneath the High Priest were the Deputy High Priests, or Second Prophets, who oversaw particular functions of the temple or its estate, such as the workshops or the farms. Beneath them were the priests responsible for particular functions like bathing the god or providing entertainment. Most priests served in shifts, working one month out of every three."

"People have speculated for centuries on how the pyramids were built. It seems unfathomable that the ancient Egyptians, without the benefit of forklifts, cranes, backhoes and a slew of other modern equipment, could have constructed such magnificent structures. \n"
"The building of any pyramid started with a well laid-out plan. The vizier, second only to the pharaoh in rank, most likely oversaw the entire process with the royal architect (known as medjeh nesu in ancient Egyptian) specifying the plans. The royal architect was responsible for choosing material and figuring out how to get the material to the site. \n"
"After the site was carefully chosen, astronomers determined the north-south axis of the pyramid. Then, surveyors laid out all sides of the pyramid using a special kind of cord that was so thick that it would not stretch and ruin the dimensions of the pyramid. Then, the ground was leveled, perhaps by filling ditches with water to determine a uniform plane. \n"
"Once these tasks were complete, construction was ready to begin. To kick off construction, a ceremony was held in which the pharaoh marked the corners of the pyramid with stakes, stretched a cord between the stakes, and placed a ceremonial mud brick as the first stone in the monument. \n"
"At this point, the <link=\"#Stonemason_Title\"><u>stonemasons</u></link> and laborers took over. For pyramids with subterranean chambers, stonemasons carved out the underground rooms, including the burial chamber. Once these were ready, the arduous process of bringing stone blocks, some of which weighed as much as 2.5 tons, began. The stones were hauled on sleds, and ramps were probably used to reach the higher parts of the pyramid. In addition to the rough-hewn stones that made up the interior of the pyramid, finer stone encased the structure. \n"
"Pyramids were generally part of larger pyramid complexes. The pyramid complex featured a valley temple that sat on the water or on the edge of the cultivated area. From the valley temple, a long causeway led to the mortuary temple, which was situated on the east side of the pyramid. \n"
"The form of pyramids evolved as the technology to build them was refined. The first pyramid, Djoser's Step Pyramid, does not have smooth sides. Built around 2620 BC, the Step Pyramid is a series of squares stacked on top of each other. The first true pyramid is Snofru's, built around 2550 BC. An outer casing smoothed the 'steps' of the pyramid, and this practice was soon adopted for other pyramids. The largest pyramid is Khufu's, which measures 252 x 252 yards (230 x 230 meters) and reaches a height of 160 yards (146 meters). One unique pyramid is Snofru's Bent Pyramid. The angle of the sides of the pyramid changes about two-thirds of the way up from the base. The speculation is that architects determined that the pyramid would have been too heavy and prone to collapse if it had continued to be built at its original angle."

"Egyptian religion featured a well-populated pantheon of major and minor gods. Most cities, and even individuals, viewed a specific god as their patron, and this practice influenced which gods held the most importance. \n"
"One of the earliest belief structures was the Ennead, or group of nine gods. Founded in the city of On (Heliopolis), the first god in the Ennead is Atum, who linked with Ra to become Ra-Atum. Ra-Atum, though male, managed to single handedly produce twins, Shu and Tefnut. Shu was god of the air, and Tefnut was goddess of moisture. Shu and Tefnut had two children: Geb, god of the earth, and Nut, goddess of the sky. Geb and Nut produced four children: Isis, Osiris, Nephthys and Seth. Rounding out the nine gods is Horus, son of Isis and Osiris. This system of gods dominated the religion of pharaonic Egypt.\n"
"According to Manetho, a historian who lived during the Ptolemaic Period, when Hor-Aha united Upper and Lower Egypt in the First Dynasty, he founded the capital at Memphis and established the cult of Ptah, a creator god. Manetho wrote that Hor-Aha maintained that the Ennead gods were all manifestations of Ptah. However, Ra remained the predominant god Heliopolis. \n"
"Another creation myth was founded in the Upper Egyptian city of Khmun (Hermopolis). The Hermopolitans theology consists of the Ogdoad, or group of eight gods. In the Ogdoad, a pair of male and female gods represented different aspects of the cosmos. Nun and Naunent represented the primordial waters, Huh and Hauhet represented unendingness, Kuk and Kauket were gods of primordial darkness, and Amon and Amaunet were gods of inactivity whose names mean \"the hidden one\". \n"
"In the New Kingdom, Amon unseated Ra as the primary god. Amon's domination continued until the reign of Akhenaten. Akhenaten attempted to introduced a new theology into Egypt, maintaining that the god Aten, who was embodied by the sun's disk, was the primary god. Some scholars have suggested his religion may have been an early format of monotheism, but this is hotly debated. During his rule, known today as the Amarna period, Akhenaten closed down the temples of other gods. Upon his death, however, traditional religion was quickly reintroduced, and the temples to other gods were reopened."

Not long before the advent of pyramid building, there were advancements in building boats that would be helpful and even necessary for large-scale construction projects. Ships were important in transporting heavy materials needed for the construction of the pyramids. \n"
"Like other industries in Egypt, shipwrights were government-owned operations. Equipped with woodworking tools, ship builders first made the hull of the boat by laying planks side by side and securing them with dowels, glue, and ropes designed to shrink when wet. When the ropes shrank, the hull was held fast. Hulls of larger boats were ribbed. Once the hull was complete, the shipwrights outfitted the rest of the boat, including a mast for the sail and holes for oars. Some of the larger ships had cabins. \n"
"The ships were broad-beamed and designed to ride very high on the surface of the water, which helped them stay afloat. The Nile, though relatively easy to navigate, did have its share of shoals and shallow points, and it was easy for ships to run aground. \n"
"Shipwrights built ships of significant size. One boat, used to transport obelisks to Hatshepsut's temple, measured 89 yards (82 meters) in length. One of the most famous archaeological finds is Khufu's barge. Found in about 1,224 pieces along the south side of Khufu's pyramid, the barge was reconstructed in the early 1960s. The boat is over 46 yards (42 meters) long and 6.5 yards (6 meters) wide, with spots for 10 rowers plus an additional two that steered the boat. Historians are unsure of the significance of the boat.

Citizens took part in the care of the gods through offerings, but they rarely saw the statue of the god hidden deep inside the temple. Only on feast days, when the god was carried through town on a ceremonial bark, did citizens actually catch a glimpse of the deity, though the deity was still hidden within a portable shrine.\n"
"Egyptians turned to the gods for advice. Everyone was welcome into the forecourt of the temple, and here people could query the gods regarding subjects that puzzled them or ask forgiveness for past wrongs. The priests, hidden from view, responded to the beseechers. Citizens could also ask questions of the god on feast days when the god was out and about. \n"
"In addition to paying homage at the temples, most Egyptians had shrines in their homes. Frequently, the shrine was of Bes, the protector god of the household. Individuals seem to have had their own patron gods as well. In an attendance record uncovered at Deir el-Medina, workers are sometimes absent to celebrate the 'festival of their god.' \n"
"The concept of a patron god extended to cities, towns and regions. That idea caused shifts in the gods worshipped at different periods during Egyptian history. For more on the evolution of religion, click <link=\"#Religion_Title\"><u>here</u></link>."

"While ancient Egypt was replete with natural resources, the land did lack some goods. The Egyptians opened trade routes with many nearby countries and regions, including Nubia, Lebanon, Syria, Punt (which historians speculate is the coast of Somalia) and the Aegean, among others. Some sources claim that Egyptian trade extended as far north as modern-day Turkey. \n"
"The Nile again played an important role in Egyptian trade. The river was navigable through the first cataract, or set of rocky waterfalls. It acted as a road and made travel to and from Nubia relatively easy. \n"
"The Nile also helped to provide one of Egypt's main exports: grain. The Inundation proved to be much more reliable than the rain in Lebanon and Syria. As long as the Inundation occurred, Egypt had a surplus of grain, a luxury Lebanon and Syria did not frequently have. Egypt's other exports included linen, papyrus, lentils, dried fish, gold and silver vessels, ox hides and rope. \n"
"In exchange, Egypt received a variety of goods as imports. Among the most important are gold from Nubia, wood from Lebanon and olive oil from Syria. The Egyptians also imported other luxury items, such as myrrh and wine, and livestock. The Egyptians also occasionally imported weapons. \n"
"Laden with goods, caravans were especially prone to attack. For protection, armed units accompanied caravans on their trade missions. Because of these armed units, some historians speculate that Egypt did not always engage in free trade with its neighbors, but rather bullied neighbors into giving up goods. While coercion probably played some role in Egyptian trade, some papyri also refer to negotiations between Egypt and its trade partners. There are several documents inscribed on clay tablets that give details of luxury goods sent to and from kings of the Near East. Punt and Crete always had peaceful trade.\n"
"Some successful trade missions were celebrated with inscriptions and artwork. Hatshepsut, a female pharaoh, sent a fleet of ships to Punt to procure myrrh, frankincense, ivory and other fine goods. The trip was deemed so successful that it is recorded on the walls of Hatshepsut's temple at Deir el-Bahri."

"The Valley of the Kings was the necropolis for five centuries of pharaohs, "
"ca. 1539-1075 BC, including Thutmose I, Tutankhamun and Ramses the Great "
"(Ramses II). Located on the western bank of the Nile across from the temple "
"complex at Thebes, the Valley is overlooked by el-Qurn, a naturally pyramid-"
"shaped mountain that receives the last blessings of Ra each day before the "
"sun sets.  Between the Valley and the great Nile are the royal mortuary "
"temples built for individual pharaohs who expected to enjoy their afterlives"
" in the Valley's tombs. A nearby village, Deir el-Medina, housed hundreds of"
" workers and their families. Specialized workers prepared the Royal Burial "
"Tombs, and each had an important task to carry out. "

"before the <link=\"#Artisans_Title\"><u>artisans</u></link> arrived to "
"decorate the ceilings and walls with carved bas-reliefs and paintings that "
"would help guide the pharaoh through his afterlife. The deceased king was "

"worthy of the deified status granted him by the ancient Egyptians. Because "
"of these great treasures, the tombs were frequently robbed, sometimes by the"
" very people who were placed to guard them. European archaeologists "
"rediscovered the Valley of the Kings in the early 1800s. In 1922 Howard "
"Carter broke through the sealed tomb of Tutankhamun to find many treasures, "
"including gold coffins and shrines, beds, statues, and other royal "
"furniture.  Over the centuries, flash floods have filled many of the tombs "
"with silt and debris, and it is a good bet that there are passageways - and "
"maybe even some tombs - as yet undiscovered in the Valley."

"Getting drinking water to the populace was a bit of a challenge in ancient Egypt. The main water source was the Nile and the Nile's water table. Away from the Nile, there were a few oases, but most of the land was arid. \n"
"To get water to neighborhoods, cisterns were built in well-to-do houses. Water carriers brought buckets full of water to these houses, and emptied them into the cisterns. \n"
"The Egyptians were adept at digging wells. Workers had to dig through 300 feet of rock for one well near the worker's settlement at Giza. Most wells had a well house capping them. From the well house, stairs wound down to the water's level. From there, people could fill their jugs with water."

"Native trees were not plentiful in Egypt. While the soil on the floodplains would be fertile enough to support tree growth, the flood itself would uproot trees before they had a chance to grow. Trees that did manage to grow in Egypt included the sycamore, the persea tree, the date palm and the horseradish tree. Each of these trees was accorded religious significance and viewed as a dwelling place for the gods. \n"
"Because of their special significance, wood cutters had to receive special permission before cutting trees down. The trees that were cut produced brittle wood that had limited uses. Egypt imported most of its wood from what is now Lebanon, Syria, and Israel. When Egypt eventually conquered these lands during the New Kingdom, they harvested trees with abandon, significantly depleting the tree stock. Ebony wood was also imported from Nubia.\n"
"Wood was used for furniture, coffins and in buildings. Wood workers were quite adept at fashioning intricately designed pieces complete with inlays and engravings."

"Ancient Egyptians were fond of the fun and the unusual, and both could be "

"zoological gardens, which would inevitably be found a short distance from "
"the ruler's palace. Evidently, some zoos of Egypt may have been primarily "
"for public spectacle and secondarily for study. Alexandria's Great Library "
"purportedly had both a botanical garden and a zoological yard on its "
"grounds. At a Predynastic cemetery at Hierakonpolis, several exotic animals "
"were given exquisite burials. It is unclear if they formed a zoo or were "
"personal pets, or were part of some larger ritual purpose."
