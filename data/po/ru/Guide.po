"Without Bazaars, people will never have access to the food and goods stored "
"in the <link=\"#Granary_Title\"><u>Granaries</u></link> and "
"<link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage Yards</u></link>. Only Bazaars "
"distribute needed supplies to the populace. To function properly, Bazaars "
"need road access and a full staff. The Bazaar will still function if it is "
"understaffed, but at a much reduced efficiency. Each Bazaar employs two "
"buyers, one to purchase food from Granaries, the other to purchase items "
"from Storage Yards. Each buyer is specialized: the Granary buyer cannot "
"procure items from a Storage Yard, and vice versa. Each of these buyers, "
"however, can buy more than one item at a time. So, for example, a Bazaar "
"buyer that goes to the Granary can buy grain and pomegranates. She cannot, "
"however, buy grain and pottery, because pottery is never stored in a "
"Granary. Once a Bazaar buyer finds the items she needs, a string of helpers "
"carries the load back to the Bazaar. \n"
"The Bazaar buyer is a <link=\"#Walkers_Title\"><u>\"destination walker\"</"
"u></link>. She spends her life shuttling between her Bazaar and the city's "
"Granaries and Storage Yards. Her job description exempts her from walking "
"clear across the city to reach supplies, and she won't do business with "
"supply sources outside of her range. If you catch her standing around when "
"there's work to be done, you're probably expecting her to walk too far or "
"deal with too many suppliers. \n"
"The other Bazaar employee, the Bazaar trader, takes the items that buyers "
"bring back and distributes them to nearby neighborhoods. As the trader "
"passes within two spaces of housing, she supplies each house with whatever "
"it needs if she has the items in stock. The first priority is to replenish "
"the items a house needs to keep from devolving (see the "
"<link=\"#HousingDesirability_Title\"><u>housing & desirability</u></link> "
"entry). When those needs are satisfied, they try to get the next item the "
"house needs to improve. The Bazaar trader, then, is a \"roaming walker\". "
"Her purpose is to wander through nearby blocks and serve her customers, "
"rather than to proceed to some specific destination. If a particular housing "
"section is not receiving goods, watch where the trader walks. She does not "
"follow a set route. Every time she encounters an intersection, she chooses "
"which way to go, and she won't always take the same path. Plan the city's "
"roads carefully, and use <link=\"#Roadblock_Title\"><u>Roadblocks</u></link> "
"to corral Bazaar traders. A Bazaar that has evolved to its more advanced "
"state (shown by one of its tents being replaced by a small building) sends "
"out two \"roaming walkers\" instead of one.  People's needs for basic "
"commodities, like food and pottery, must be met before more advanced wants, "
"like beer or linen, are addressed. Bazaar buyers will ignore a Storage Yard "
"brimming with linen if the houses they serve are crying out for pottery. "
"It's very important, then, to maintain steady supplies of a commodity once "
"houses start demanding it. Remember that as houses evolve, they usually hold "
"more people and, so, consume more goods. Sometimes you'll have to add more "
"Bazaars to keep a neighborhood properly stocked. Click on a house to see "
"what its occupants need at any given moment.\n"
"To help make sure that residents are getting the food and goods they need, "
"build Granaries and Storage Yards near Bazaars. Use the Granary's and "
"Storage Yard's special orders to make sure they have the goods and foods "
"that the Bazaars need. If you want more control over a Bazaar, Click on it "
"to see a list of all the commodities that it can stock. Click on an item to "
"tell the Bazaar whether or not to buy it. While citizens need to live near "
"Bazaars to have access to all the goods they desire, no one wants to live "
"too close to them. They are noisy places, sometimes filled with unsavory "
"characters, and can be smelly too."

"as they also have access to a road. \n"
"The labor seeker's job is not always easy. One of the greatest challenges as "

"available. In a perfect world, a city would have exactly the same number of "
"jobs as people who want them. This hardly ever happens. A city will either "

"<link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>sentiment</u></link> of the city down. "
"They could even turn to <link=\"#Crime_Title\"><u>crime</u></link>. The best "

"entertainment facilities, and new Schools, Libraries or Temples can benefit "
"the city. While reducing unemployment, you could increase the city's "
"Prosperity and Culture ratings. Another - albeit heartless - way to reduce "

"destroying people's homes, forcing emigration. This, too, can have a "
"positive effect on the city. If you destroy lower level housing, the overall "
"value of the city's housing stock will increase. This increase could result "
"in a higher Prosperity rating. \n"
"The other employment problem you will face is the labor shortage, or having "
"too many jobs for the available workforce. The ideal solution to a labor "
"shortage is to attract new immigrants. Build new housing areas or encourage "
"existing areas to evolve into larger structures. Make sure that "
"<link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>City Sentiment</u></link> is high, too. "
"Paying more than the prevailing wage in Egypt or lowering the city's tax "
"rate can also attract new immigrants. While you are waiting for the influx "

"<link=\"#OverseerWorkers_Title\"><u>Overseer of the Workers</u></link> to "
"alleviate the shortage. Talk to your Overseer of the Workers about setting "

"<link=\"#Workers_Title\"><u>workers'</u></link> homes. You'll damage the "
"city's Prosperity rating and decrease its tax revenues, but the labor force "
"will increase - at the cost of your wealthiest citizens' hopes and dreams! "
"Although being out of work is quite stressful for the jobless, a small "

"Floodplain Farming: To understand how floodplain farms work, you must first "
"understand the Nile's stages. Every year, usually between June and "
"September, the Nile floods its banks. The flood plains are completely "
"submerged, and nothing can be placed on the land. In a few months, the Nile "
"begins to recede, leaving nutritious silt behind that fertilizes the soil. "
"The flood plain reemerges, and you can again operate farms on the flood "
"plain. The Nile does not flood at exactly the same time or in exactly the "
"same way every year. Some floods are better than others. Priests use "
"Nilometers to determine how good the next flood will be and report their "
"findings to your <link=\"#ChiefOverseer_Title\"><u>Chief Overseer</u></"
"link>. Paying special attention to Osiris, God of Agriculture and the Nile "
"Flood <link=\"#Religion_Title\"><u>(see Religion)</u></link>, can help "
"ensure successful floods every year. You can build farms (and roads, and "
"Irrigation Ditches) on the flood plain at any time except during the flood. "
"When you build a floodplain farm, only the field appears, with no buildings, "
"because the flood destroys any buildings on the floodplain. Since they can't "
"build homes on the floodplain farms, peasants need a place to meet to be "
"assigned to work. <link=\"#WorkCamp_Title\"><u>Work Camps</u></link> serve "
"this function. \n"
"Work Camps dispatch workers to the farms to plant and reap the crops, and "
"farms lie idle unless there is a Work Camp.  There's a limit to how far "
"peasants will walk to reach their back-breaking assignments, so don't put "
"Work Camps too far from the fields. The best time to build farms is soon "
"after the flood recedes. You'll be able to take full advantage of the "
"growing season until the next flood, and the farm will have maximum yield. "
"Farms placed at any other time will produce less. The other factor to "
"consider when placing farms is fertility. The darker the land and lusher the "
"grass, the more fertile the land is. The most fertile land is usually found "
"directly adjacent to the river. As you move away from the river, the land "
"becomes less fertile. Farms placed on the most fertile land produce the "
"highest yields. You can build Irrigation Ditches on flood plains to irrigate "
"the land farthest from the river, thereby improving the fertility of land "
"which might be left high and dry during a poor Inundation. Due to the annual "
"rhythm of the Nile, floodplain farms can produce only one crop each year. A "
"city's survival can depend on having enough workers to harvest the crop, and "
"enough storage space to accept the harvest.\n"
"\n"
"Meadow Farming: Floodplain land is not the only fertile land, although it "
"forms the bulk of available arable land. Farms can also be placed on "
"meadows, denoted by yellow tufts. The denser these tufts are, the more "
"fertile the land is, resulting in larger yields. These farms do have a work "
"building on site, so they do not need peasants from a Work Camp. Because the "
"land is not flooded, these farms continue to work throughout the year. "
"However, acre for acre, meadow land is less fertile than floodplain land, "
"and farms on the meadow tend to yield fewer crops per harvest.  Meadow farms "
"almost always benefit from Irrigation Ditches.\n"
"\n"
"Hunting and Fishing: Hunters and fishermen take advantage of Egypt's natural "
"abundance. Both set out from their bases, capture their prey, and return "
"back to their bases to prepare the food. Hunters work out of Hunting Lodges. "
"From the Lodge, they set out for the hunt. Hunters will look for flocks of "
"ostriches, waterfowl, or a herd of antelope. If you notice any of these "
"animals around the city, place a Hunting Lodge nearby. Fishermen gather at "
"Fishing Wharves where they swap stories about the one that got away. "
"Wharves, of course, are located on the water, and fishermen need a "
"Shipwright to build them a boat. Once they have a boat, they'll set out. Not "
"every city can support hunting or fishing. If you notice fish jumping out of "
"the water, the city can have a fishing industry.   Herd, flock and school "
"sizes are limited.  Hunting and fishing can provide a small population with "
"enough food, but a large population will not be able to subsist solely on "
"fish or game meat.\n"
"\n"
"Cattle Ranching Cattle Ranches can be an excellent source of additional "
"food. They can be placed on any type of land - not just fertile land - which "
"saves arable land for another purpose.  Cattle consume straw, the by-product "
"of <link=\"#GrainFarm_Title\"><u>grain farming</u></link>. The number of "
"cattle ranches a city can have is limited only by the amount of straw the "
"city can devote to cattle feed.\n"
"\n"
"Food Distribution: <link=\"#Granary_Title\"><u>Granaries</u></link> and "
"<link=\"#Bazaar_Title\"><u>Bazaars</u></link> are the intermediaries between "
"food producers and the city's inhabitants. Granaries store the food intended "
"for consumption by people, and Bazaars distribute it to individual homes.   "
"Once a food producer has an item ready, a cartpusher brings the food to a "
"Granary. Bazaar buyers go to the Granaries to procure the food their "
"customers are asking for. They can carry more than one type of food at a "
"time. After the buyers return to the Bazaar with their items, Bazaar traders "
"walk through the neighborhood, delivering food to the populace. It's "
"important to have enough Granaries and Bazaars. If all Granaries are full, "
"the cartpusher takes the food to a <link=\"#StorageYard_Title\"><u>Storage "
"Yard</u></link>, if it has been instructed to accept food. Bazaar buyers "
"won't procure locally-produced food from Storage Yards (although they will "
"take non-food items and imported foods there). Bazaar buyers get most food "
"from Granaries. Placing Bazaars and Granaries can be tricky. Granaries "
"should be close to the food producers so that cartpushers don't have far to "
"travel.  Bazaars should be close to Granaries so the Bazaar buyers can keep "
"their Bazaars well-stocked.  Bazaars also need proximity to the houses they "
"will serve.  All of these structures make for undesirable neighbors, so "
"siting them always involves tradeoffs.   As your city grows, you might have "
"to build Granaries further away from the food producers to ensure that "
"Bazaars in outlying neighborhoods can procure the food they need. If you "
"find that you need to do this, use the Granary's Special Orders to make sure "
"it receives food.\n"
"\n"
"Importing Food: Some cities cannot produce enough food to sustain "
"themselves, or can produce only limited varieties of food, and so need to "
"import food from other cities. Imported food is delivered to Storage Yards, "
"where Bazaar buyers can pick up the foodstuffs and bring it back to the "
"Bazaar."

"Getting Out of Debt: Debt is clearly a serious problem, and when you can't "
"avoid it, you need to retire your debt as quickly as possible. Ways to raise "
"money are discussed below, but you should also refrain from spending any of "
"your limited credit on anything that will not ultimately earn you money.  "
"Tax Collector's offices, industries that make exportable commodities and new "
"trade routes with cities that will buy your products could all be wise "
"expenditures.\n"
"\n"
"Taxes: Taxes charge citizens for all the services the city provides them. "
"Citizens won't grumble about paying taxes as long as the tax rate is "
"reasonable. The initial tax rate of 9 percent is a good benchmark, but you "
"can raise or lower the rate at any time. Visit your Overseer of the Treasury "
"or Click on the Palace to adjust the rate. Lowering the tax rate buys you "
"joy and appreciation. Raising the tax rate prompts complaints, and could "
"lead to a mass exodus of citizens from the city. Raising the tax rate may be "
"necessary sometimes. If you notice that your city is about to go into debt, "
"you can raise the tax rate to alleviate the problem. You should probably "
"find an alternate long-term solution to your city's money problems, though. "
"A high tax rate can quickly worsen <link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>City "
"Sentiment</u></link>. While citizens don't mind paying taxes, they won't "
"volunteer a portion of their income without being asked. To collect taxes, "
"the city must have a <link=\"#Palace_Title\"><u>Palace</u></link>. Then, "
"build <link=\"#TaxCollector_Title\"><u>Tax Collectors' offices</u></link> to "
"actually collect the tax. The Overseer of the Treasury knows what percentage "
"of your population is registered for the tax, and how much tax income was "
"not collected because of a lack of tax collectors. Also, make sure that you "
"levy taxes in the city fairly.  If a portion of the city's inhabitants is "
"paying a high tax rate and the other portion is not paying any at all, "
"<link=\"#PopulationGrowth_Title\"><u>City Sentiment</u></link> will plunge, "
"and <link=\"#Crime_Title\"><u></u>crime</link> could break out.\n"
"\n"
"Trade: Money from exports will likely be the city's main source of income. "
"Open up trade routes as soon as possible. It's crucial that you understand "
"how to export commodities, so be sure to read up on "
"<link=\"#Trade_Title\"><u>trade</u></link> if this gives you problems.\n"
"\n"
"Mining Gold: Some cities can manufacture their own money. Gold is converted "
"into debens, the basic currency in Egypt. If you see metal nuggets embedded "
"in an outcropping of rock, then you might be able to build a "
"<link=\"#GoldMine_Title\"><u>Gold Mine</u></link>. Don't get too excited; "
"the ore might turn out to be <link=\"#GoldMine_Title\"><u>copper</u></link>, "
"which is quite valuable in its own right but usually not as welcome as gold. "
"Gold Mines function like other <link=\"#Industry_Title\"><u>industries</u></"
"link>, but their output is delivered only to the Palace, where it is turned "
"into debens, and never to a Storage Yard.\n"
"\n"
"Family Savings and Salary: Like the city, you, too, can earn money. You are "
"paid for your efforts as city leader and can draw a wage as soon as you "
"build yourself a <link=\"#Mansion_Title\"><u>Mansion</u></link>. Your salary "
"is paid to you from the city's treasury, and your wage is commensurate with "
"your experience. You can choose to alter your wage, but if you pay yourself "
"too much more than you are worth, your <link=\"#Ratings_Title\"><u>Kingdom "
"Rating</u></link> could tumble. You can also pay yourself less money, or not "
"pay yourself at all, which can impress people and help your Kingdom rating. "
"If your city is having financial difficulties, not paying yourself a salary "
"is a good way to cut costs. You can transfer family savings to the city "
"treasury at any time - a good way to erase or prevent debt.  You can never "
"transfer treasury money to your family account, though.  That would be "
"embezzling! Your family savings can also purchase a \"gift for Egypt\".  "
"Such donations to the people of Egypt, or, at your Overseer's discretion, to "
"other Egyptian leaders will immediately improve your Kingdom rating by a "
"small amount. Be careful with this stratagem, though. Once the gifts begin, "
"their recipients come to expect them, especially if you have been handing "
"them out on a regular basis. Cutting them off can actually harm your rating."

"When your city is new, immigrants eagerly approach the city with their "

"established, it needs to provide more amenities to attract new immigrants "
"and keep the inhabitants it has. The best way to keep residents from "
"emigrating is to keep them in a good mood, resulting in high City "
"Sentiment.\n"
"\n"
"City Sentiment takes several parameters into account, the most important "
"being:\n"
"- Taxation, if you decide to go over the recommended 9% tax rate, your City "
"Sentiment will suffer. Only go over if you can compensate for it. On the "
"flip side, lowering tax will increase the City Sentiment.\n"
"- Wages, if you happen to pay your workers lower than what the rest of Egypt "
"does, it will hurt your City Sentiment. Paying higher than Egypt will help, "
"up to a point.\n"
"- Employment, while missing workers doesn’t have an impact (people tend to "
"immigrate when jobs are available), a high unemployment rate will definitely "
"hurt City Sentiment. Try to keep it contained to 10% so it doesn’t have any "
"negative effect.\n"
"- Slums, once you attract a higher class of citizens in your city (starting "
"with common manors), people living in crude and sturdy huts will be less "
"happy and this will hurt your city sentiment. Evolving these low level "
"houses quickly will normalize the situation.\n"
"\n"
"Failure to meet citizens' needs can cause a wave of emigration. Emigration "
"can sometimes be the start of a vicious circle: emigrants leave because of "
"lack of services, but in leaving they cause a worker shortage. This worker "
"shortage causes even more services to suffer.\n"
"You should avoid at all costs making conditions so bad in the city that "
"people leave en masse. Your population can also grow and shrink as a result "
"of births and deaths. Check in with your "
"<link=\"#OverseerGranaries_Title\"><u>Overseer of the Granaries</u></link> "

"Ratings are a mark of how good the city is or how well you are doing as a "

"\n"
"Culture: The Culture Rating assesses how much access your citizens have to "
"<link=\"#Entertainment_Title\"><u>entertainment</u></link>, "
"<link=\"#Education_Title\"><u>education</u></link>, "
"<link=\"#Health_Title\"><u>health</u></link> and "
"<link=\"#Religion_Title\"><u>religion</u></link>. \n"
"The Culture rating measures not only the number of facilities you have, but "
"also the variety of options. To achieve a high Culture rating, be sure to "
"provide citizens with plenty of options. This means easy access to multiple "
"forms of entertainment, health services (except Apothecaries - they have no "
"effect on the Culture rating) and religion. For wealthier citizens, access "
"to both Libraries and Scribal Schools is a must to keep the Culture rating "
"on the rise, but access is not the entire story.  People learn better in "
"quiet, uncrowded facilities, and your Culture rating reflects the quality of "
"education by measuring how many people use each school and Library.  It's "
"possible to have enough educational buildings to provide access for every "
"house in the city, and yet still suffer from overcrowding. To earn the "
"highest Culture rating, see if you can build a <link=\"#Zoo_Title\"><u>Zoo</"
"u></link>. You'll need to build a Zoo if you need to attain a Culture rating "
"higher than 75.\n"
"\n"
"Prosperity: The Prosperity rating measures a city's wealth and its financial "
"security. The rating goes far beyond an assessment of the city's treasury: "
"it also looks at the wealth of its citizens, taking into account the value "
"of their property and the unemployment level. If the city earns a profit "
"every year, its Prosperity rating should continue to rise if nothing else in "
"the city is holding the rating back. High unemployment, low-level housing "
"and low wages will stunt the rating's growth. Failure to pay tribute to the "
"Kingdom will also decrease this rating. If a Temple Complex or Senet House "
"is functioning in the city, its Prosperity rating rises, because people feel "
"like the city is well-off if it has such glorious structures in it. "
"Finishing a monument also gives the Prosperity rating a boost.  When the "
"city ends the year in debt or loses money, the Prosperity rating suffers. "
"However, if the city lost money because of construction costs, its "
"Prosperity rating isn't affected, because expenditures on construction "
"improve the city.\n"
"\n"
"Kingdom: The Kingdom rating represents your reputation, especially with the "
"rest of Egypt. Quick response to an ally's request for help can increase the "
"rating. Failure to comply with requests will hurt the Kingdom rating. If the "
"Kingdom rating falls too low, your shoddy reputation might provoke an attack "
"by Pharaoh or by a neighboring city. You'll usually begin each mission with "
"a rating of 50, which indicates neutrality. People outside your city have "
"barely even heard of you, and those who do know your name and history have "
"few opinions about you. Over time, if you do nothing to improve it, your "
"Kingdom rating gradually falls as word goes out that you are of little "
"importance beyond your city's borders. The rating falls more dramatically if "
"you lose or ignore distant battles, fail to comply with requests for goods "
"or other demands from the rest of the Kingdom, and remain in "
"<link=\"#Money_Title\"><u>debt</u></link> for any length of time. Drawing a "
"salary beyond the standard for your rank doesn't help matters, either. \n"
"To raise your Kingdom rating, fulfill requests from Pharaoh or other "
"Egyptian cities promptly, especially when they ask for military aid. Victory "
"in battle can do wonders for your reputation. Sometimes even losing a battle "
"might help a little bit, since you at least tried to rescue your countrymen "
"in their hour of need. For a quick pick-me-up in your reputation, use your "
"family savings to buy a gift for Egypt. Your Political Overseer sends the "
"gift of your choice to Pharaoh, or to other Egyptian leaders, or to the "
"people of Egypt - wherever he feels that it will do the most good. Your "
"Kingdom rating will rise by a few points immediately. Resist the temptation "
"to spend all of your savings on gifts, though. They lose their effectiveness "
"if they become too frequent, and the recipients will come to expect them. "
"Eventually, your rating might even decline if you stop sending gifts or send "
"cheaper gifts than the recipients have grown to expect.  Exceeding one gift "
"per year is of questionable effectiveness, and could even be "
"counterproductive. Your Kingdom rating's natural tendency to decline lessens "
"a bit if you draw a personal salary below that defined for your rank.  "
"Drawing no salary at all is even better for your reputation as a selfless "
"public servant - although it isn't the best strategy for building up your "
"family's wealth!\n"
"\n"
"Monument The Monument rating comes from both the size and scope of any "
"monuments in the city, as well as how far along they are in construction.  "
"If you complete all the monuments required and remember to dispatch any "
"necessary burial provisions to provide for the deceased's afterlife, you "
"will have no problem meeting the Monument Rating goal.\n"

"city move easier over long, straight roads rather than short roads with lots "
"of twists, turns and intersections. Nearly all structures in your city need "
"access to roads. The only exceptions are Gardens, Statues, and Forts. "
"Shrines, Walls and housing do not need direct road access, but must be "
"within two spaces of the road to receive benefits from passing walkers. "
"Walkers can only cross the boundary between the flood plain and dry land "
"where there's a road. This embankment is steep, muddy and treacherous, but a "
"road permits safe passage. All roads have the same traffic capacity, and "
"walkers move at the same speed, regardless of whether or not they are "
"paved.\n"
"\n"
"The Kingdom Road: The road running through your lands when you begin a new "
"mission is the Kingdom road, and it has a special status. Trade caravans and "
"immigrants arrive on the Kingdom road, and emigrants leave by it. Every part "
"of your city needs a clear path to the Kingdom road. If you isolate some "
"part of the city from this important thoroughfare, that area will stagnate. "
"Any delivery people who were en route to the now-isolated enclave will stop "
"in their tracks until access is restored. This doesn't mean that every one "
"of your city's streets has to physically connect to the Kingdom road, merely "
"that all buildings must have a clear, walkable path, whether via road or "
"empty land. Chances are that this is all you need to know about the Kingdom "
"road.\n"
"\n"
"Building on Two Roads: Sometimes, you might place a building adjacent to two "
"roads that are either unconnected to each other, or connected far from the "
"building. This does not let walkers leave or enter the building from both "
"roads. Every building can have only one entry and one exit point and so only "
"one active road. For example, suppose that you build a Storage Yard with a "
"road on its southern side. Manufacturers, caravans and Bazaar buyers south "
"of the Storage Yard will interact with it just as you would expect. Now say "
"that you want industries north of the yard to use it, too.  If you build a "
"road on the northern side of the Storage Yard, you might expect that "
"industries to the north will interact with the yard using the northern road, "
"while industries to the south will continue to use the road to the south. "
"But the building can have only one access point, so those industries to the "
"north are out of luck unless you build a connector between the northern and "
"southern roads. When a building does have two or more roads adjacent to it, "
"it chooses its access point by going clockwise around the building starting "
"from the northern corner. To avoid unpredictable behavior, don't construct "
"buildings that touch two unconnected roads. Either connect the roads, or "
"know that only one of them will actually carry traffic that can interact "
"with the building. By hovering your mouse over a building, the game will "
"show you its actual access points."

"Importing: To import a good, click on the commodity you want. After you "
"select an item, you have two choices. You can decide for yourself how much "
"of the item you would like the city to have on hand and instruct your "
"Overseer of Commerce to behave accordingly. Or, you can let your Overseer of "
"Commerce decide how much the city should have on hand. Your Overseer of "
"Commerce will continue to import the item as long as the city's stocks are "
"under the prescribed level, or until the trade partner's annual trade limit "
"has been reached. Some goods your city needs can only be imported. These "
"include white marble for monument construction and oil for "
"<link=\"#LampMaker_Title\"><u>lamps</u></link>. To evolve the city's "
"<link=\"#HousingDesirability_Title\"><u>housing</u></link> to its highest "
"level, you will also have to import luxury goods. Imports can become quite "
"expensive, so monitor the city's <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link> carefully. "
"If you notice that the Storage Yards are full of a particular good the city "
"is importing, save money by not importing the good until stocks are "
"depleted. Also, importing raw materials is cheaper than importing finished "
"products. In the long run, the city will save money if it has its own "
"manufacturers to turn an imported raw material into a finished product. \n"
" \n"
"Exporting: To export a good, click on the item you wish to export. Then, "
"decide for yourself how much the city should have on hand or let the "
"Overseer of Commerce make the decision. Surpluses will be exported up to the "
"customer's annual quota. Keep in mind that some commodities the city exports "
"are also desired by its citizens, so make sure you keep enough in storage "
"for citizens' needs. Check in with your Bazaars and your citizens' housing "
"frequently to see if they have a supply of the good you are trading. Also, "
"make sure that the buildings that need finished goods have a supply on hand. "
"If housing and other buildings are having difficulty getting an item, the "
"city is probably exporting too much.\n"
" \n"
"Sometimes a city can either export or import the same commodity. This gives "
"you more flexibility as you plan the city's industries. If you want to "
"bolster a city's income, dedicate labor to produce the commodity and export "
"it to a trade partner. If you want to use the city's labor force for another "
"purpose, then import the product instead. The city can never simultaneously "
"import and export an item, and it won't benefit from importing the product "
"from one city just to sell it to another. Buyers pay more than sellers "
"receive, so the city will only lose money if it acts as a middleman. On the "
"other hand, importing a raw material and exporting its finished good is "
"often a very profitable proposition. Merchants approach your city either by "
"caravan or trade ship. Before you can trade with either type of merchant, "
"you must have a working Storage Yard. In addition to a Storage Yard, you "

"Virtually all of the people walking your city's streets have some purpose to "
"their travels. Some move commodities from one place to another. Others "
"provide services to homes or other buildings that they pass. Still others "
"are just arriving at or departing from your city. Only a very few elite "
"people have the luxury of free time to walk about with no errand in mind. "
"These walkers can be divided into two basic types: destination walkers and "
"roaming walkers. Each behaves quite differently.\n"
" \n"
"Destination Walkers: Destination walkers leave their places of employment "
"with a specific goal in mind. Using a map of your city's roads, they "
"determine the shortest route to their destination. Examples of destination "
"walkers include Bazaar buyers, emigrants, immigrants and delivery men.\n"
" \n"
"Roaming Walkers: Walkers who roam the city bring benefits to your citizens "
"when they pass within two spaces of housing. Some also provide valuable "
"services to the buildings in the city. Roamers leave their buildings with no "
"specific destination in mind. They try to set off in a different direction "
"every time. From there, they can be completely unpredictable. Every time "
"walkers who roam the city encounter an intersection, they must decide which "
"way to turn. They don't make the same decision every time, so houses that "
"they have passed before may not be visited again for some time. The best way "
"to corral these walkers is through good city planning. Since intersections "
"give these walkers so much freedom, keeping intersections to a minimum helps "
"to guide them to where you want them to go. \n"
" \n"
"<link=\"#Roadblock_Title\"><u>Roadblocks</u></link> are another effective "
"tool in controlling roamers. When a roamer encounters a Roadblock, he or she "
"turns around. Destination walkers ignore Roadblocks. Examples of roaming "
"walkers include Bazaar sellers, water carriers, priests and physicians. Some "
"roaming walkers behave like destination walkers under certain circumstances. "
"For example, fire marshals on their way to douse a fire behave as "
"destination walkers. At all other times, though, they are roaming walkers.\n"
" \n"
"Roaming walkers have a limited workday. Their patrols last for a certain "
"amount of time, after which they leave the streets for a while. If their "
"employer has its full complement of workers, it sends another roamer out "
"almost immediately. If the building is short of employees, there is usually "
"a delay in supplying a new roamer. Destination walkers have to work until "
"their errand is complete, even if that means walking all the way across town "
"and back. Those walkers who share both destination and roaming "
"characteristics do have a limited workday. Whatever time they must spend "
"commuting to their destination reduces the amount of time that they can "
"roam. This is most noticeable with performers, whose shows are cut short if "
"they have long commutes from their schools to their stages. Finally, note "
"that the embankment separating a flood plain from dry land is steep, muddy "
"and treacherous. No one can move to or from the flood plain unless a "
"<link=\"#Roads_Title\"><u>road</u></link> makes this boundary passable. \n"
" \n"
"Not everything that walks around the city is friendly. Dangerous animals "
"also prowl the city and its environs, heartlessly killing anyone who might "
"cross their paths. Constables will try their best to kill these beasts. "
"Animals you should watch out for are hyenas, hippos, crocodiles, asps, "
"scorpions and lions."

"Peasants gather at Work Camps to be assigned to work on nearby "
"<link=\"#FoodFarming_Title\"><u>floodplain farms</u></link> or on "
"<link=\"#MonumentConstruction_Title\"><u>monuments</u></link>. During the "
"growing season, most peasants draw farming duty. During the Inundation, "
"everyone works on the city's monument project.  If there's no monument being "
"built, peasant workers have nothing to do but play a lot of senet during the "
"Inundation. If your city has few Work Camps relative to its number of "
"floodplain farms, you will notice a distinct rhythm that's set by the "
"Inundation. \n"
"Work Camps need road access and their own staff. It is best to place Work "
"Camps near farms and monuments so that the peasants don't have far to walk. "
"Indeed, there is a limit to how far they'll trek to reach their back-"
"breaking chore. The more Work Camps the city has, the quicker monuments can "
"be built, because more laborers will be available during the growing season. "
"The number of farms one Work Camp can support depends mostly on proximity.  "
"A fully-staffed Work Camp supplies one peasant worker every week (four per "
"month). This worker walks to the nearest floodplain farm that's awaiting a "
"peasant, where he will toil for six months. When a farm is halfway through "
"its peasant's work period, Work Camp employees notice that the farm will "
"need another peasant if farming is to continue without interruption - "
"remember that the growing season lasts nine months in most regions. If "
"you're using one Work Camp to supply a very large number of farms, some "
"might never receive peasants, and those that do will have trouble keeping "
"peasant workers continuously. You could run a huge number of floodplain "
"farms with only one or two Work Camps, but many farms wouldn't reach their "
"potential, and peasants would only be available to work on the monument "
"during the Inundation. Practically speaking, one Work Camp can support four "
"to six nearby floodplain farms without interruption and still contribute "
"some peasants to the city's monument project. Adding more Work Camps spreads "
"the burden around and frees up more peasants to work on the monument during "
"the growing season."
