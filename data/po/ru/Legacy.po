"Crime can also produce <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>477tomb&robbers, but "

" hosts a tomb (Pyramid, Mastaba, Mausoleum or Royal Burial Tomb). Tomb "
"robbers are especially adept at breaking into and plundering the treasures "
"of Royal Burial Tombs. Sometimes, greed can corrupt even the happiest of "
"citizens. These greedy citizens get together with their friends and "
"speculate about the lavish burial provisions interred with the noble dead. "
"When this lust for riches gets the best of them, a crime wave breaks out, "
"and these citizens become tomb robbers! Since you cannot look deep into the "
"hearts of your citizens, you have no way of knowing when a crime wave will "
"occur. However, constables will eagerly strike down anyone who tries to "
"defile a tomb by pilfering its burial provisions."

"When a notable event occurs in the city or elsewhere in the Kingdom, you "
"receive a message describing the event.  Some of these messages are urgent "
"and require quick response on your part.  They could be requests from "
"Pharaoh or other cities, or could be directing your attention to a "
"particular trouble spot in your city. When a new message arrives, the "
"'Message' button on the Control Panel lights up and a chime sounds.  Click "
"on the button to read the message.  If the matter is extremely urgent, the "
"message is delivered to you directly and appears on the screen "
"automatically.  If the message is alerting you to some trouble in your city,"
" you can click on the alarm button within the message to proceed directly to"
" the trouble spot.   Other messages contain instructions that help you "
"manage the city more successfully.  These messages are useful guides that "
"teach important game concepts and set up short-term goals.  Meeting the "
"short-term goals outlined in these special messages enables you to win a "
"mission and move on to the next step.  These messages are marked with a blue"

"clicking on their titles in your message list.  A button at the bottom of "

"Use the Options menu to change the way Pharaoh looks and sounds. Use the "
"Display option to adjust your view and the Sound option to adjust the volume"
" of the sounds, speech and music. The Speed setting changes the rate at "
"which time passes in Pharaoh. Choose which version of the city names you "
"would like to use (either Classical or Egyptian) by selecting the Cities "
"option.  You probably have a passing familiarity with the classical names, "
"but the Egyptian option lends a bit more authenticity to Pharaoh. To control"
" the way you receive messages while playing, adjust the Popup Messages "
"settings. Most of the messages you receive appear in a popup screen. When "
"the screen pops up, the game stops until you close to screen. The Popup "
"Messages settings allow you to turn this feature off for some of the "
"messages you receive. From the category list provided, simply select which "
"types of messages you do not want to receive as a popup message by clicking "
"on the category name. The category name will appear in yellow, and messages "
"in that category will be displayed in a banner across the top of the screen."
" They will also appear in your "
"<link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>34message&list. You will not have to stop "
"governing the city to deal with the message. If you select 'Compliance Now "
"Possible' from the list, requested goods will automatically be sent from the"
" city's Storage Yards when the shipment is ready. See the entry on the "
"<link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>22Political&Overseer for more information on"
" requests.  You can turn the game's automatic save function on or off from "
"this menu.  Autosave saves your game every six months, which gives you a "
"reliable fallback if you forget to save manually or if you have computer "
"problems.  It always overwrites the same filename, so there's no danger of "
"filling up your hard drive with autosaves.  You might turn off this feature "
"to eliminate the brief pauses while the game saves itself.   To change the "
"difficulty level at any time during the game, use the Difficulty option.  "
"Note, however, that your mission score is tied to the difficulty level that "
"you choose. If you change the difficulty part way through a mission, your "
"score will be computed using the easiest level that you play. Finally, the "
"Monument Speedup option allows you to use the gods' help in building some "
"<link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>370monuments. Turn the option on, and a god "
"may choose to bless you by helping you build your monument. The gods enjoy "
"working on certain monuments only, specifically the pyramids and mastabas."

"The Overlay Selector lets you look at the city through different filters. "
"The overlays are key to city planning and managing the city's services. When"
" you choose an overlay, you will see only the buildings and walkers that "
"relate directly to the report you've chosen. Other buildings are usually "
"replaced by columns.  In most cases, the columns indicate access to a "
"particular service or city function.  The higher the column, the better the "
"building's access to the service. The exceptions to the rule are the Risks "
"Overlays, the Problems Overlay, the Desirability Overlay and the Hide Cliffs"
" Overlay.  With the Risks Overlays, housing and other buildings are still "
"replaced by columns, but the taller and redder the column the greater the "
"risk.  The Problems Overlay shows the buildings that are not operating "
"properly or that are about to develop a serious problem.  Icons indicating "
"the problem appear on top of the building.  This overlay also shows cart "
"pushers who have stalled because they have no place to bring their goods or "
"food. With the Desirability Overlay selected, the city's land is replaced by"
" different colored blocks.  Gold blocks indicate the areas that people find "
"the most desirable.  The browner the block, the less desirable the area. For"
" more on desirability, click <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>56here. If "
"cliffs are blocking your view, use the Hide Cliffs Overlay to temporarily "
"flatten them. If you have any Royal Burial Tombs built into the cliffs, "
"you'll be able to see into them when you've selected the Hide Cliffs "
"Overlay.  Finally, the Water Overlay is a little different from the other "
"overlays as well. Access to water carriers is shown with blue columns that "
"grow taller with better access.  This overlay also shows which land can "
"support water-related structures and which land has access to drinking water"
" from a well.  Dark blue squares mark the housing that has well water, and "
"light blue squares show which land has the necessary groundwater to support "
"a <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>62Well, "
"<link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>61Water&Supply or other building that needs "
"groundwater access. The best way to familiarize yourself with the different "
"overlays is to experiment with them. Once you understand the information "
"they provide, you will be able to plan your city more efficiently."

"To station a <link=\"#_Title\"><u></u></link>37company in the field, or to simply instruct it to move to a new location, click on it and then click on a new location.  The company's standard will appear in the new location, and the company will march towards it, assuming that the soldiers can get there.  Note that the steep, muddy embankment between a flood plain and dry land is impassible except where a road connects the two terrains.   You can issue a company the following orders:  \n"
"Hold Ground in Tight Formation In tight formation, soldiers stand as close to each other as possible.  Because they have been told to hold ground, they will not leave their position to attack enemies.  They will attack any enemy that comes within their range, though.  The tight formation reduces the amount of ground that the soldiers can defend and makes them an easier target for enemy arrows.  Their shoulder-to-shoulder stance enhances their defensive strength in close combat.   \n"
"Hold Ground in Loose Formation  This command can only be issued to infantry and archers; it cannot be issued to charioteers.  Soldiers in loose formation spread out to cover more ground while holding their positions.  They will attack if an enemy comes into range.  This formation makes infantry and archers less vulnerable to enemy arrows, but does not offer much protection against enemy infantry attack, as each soldier in the line can effectively only defend himself.   \n"
"Engage Nearby Enemies When given this order, a company moves to attack enemies in their immediate vicinity.  The attack continues until the enemy is killed or retreats, or until you issue a different order...or until your own defeated company's morale breaks and your men head back to their Fort. \n"
"Mop-Up   When told to mop-up, soldiers seek out any enemies in a wide area and attack them.  Companies under mop-up orders are at their most aggressive, and they break formation entirely to fearlessly battle the foe.  Fearlessness, however, does hamper their ability to defend themselves, so this order is best used when the city's army outnumbers its enemies.   \n"
"Charge  The charge command can be issued only to charioteers.  Charging an enemy line breaks up its formation, making the enemy more vulnerable to attack.  When told to charge, the charioteers work the horses up into a lather, and they pull the chariots at top speed for a great distance.  Eventually, the horses tire and the chariots slow down and need to rest, so issue this order sparingly.   \n"
"Return to Fort   Click Return to Fort when your soldiers have done their duty and defeated the enemy.  At the Fort, they can rest up for the next battle.   If morale is low, they'll return to Fort on their own.  \n"
"In addition to issuing the specific orders outlined above, you can also tell companies to attack by selecting them and clicking on an enemy.  The company will pursue the targeted enemy to the death unless you issue a different order. \n"
